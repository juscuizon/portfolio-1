Strenght can lead to size. Focus on building strength first and then body buiding second. When you are able to lift more you will be able to gain more muscle.

The first step to increasing your strength is to have a proper training plan for your strength goals. 





Planning your strength goals is crucial to progress towards a more powerful gym session. 



  

Adding 5 pounds to each session for all your compound excercise using any 5x5 program can greatly increase your strength in a couple of months.





After achieving your strength goals you can now lift heavier weights and continue to build your body by switching to a body building program with high reps but your strength will be greatly increased because of your strenght program that you started as a foundation to your body building program.
